# Lab 3

The task can be found in the PDF file. Here's an initial UML chart before beginning to code:

To install the geometry_shapes package, navigate inside the top geometry_shapes directory, then run

```pip install -e .```

This tells pip to install the Python package in the current directory. The ``-e`` flag tells pip to install the package in editable mode, which means that any changes you make to the package will be reflected in the installed package.

### Still to do
* Overloads and overrides
* Spheres and cubes
* Drawing the shapes
* Unit testing
* Docstrings
