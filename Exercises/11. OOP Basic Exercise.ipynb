Also, there needs to be an internal/private attribute that keeps track of if the glass is empty or full. Depending on the current state (empty/full), the method that fills the glass should print either \"Filling the glass with water\" or \"The glass is already full\". The other method should print either \"Emptying the glass\" or \"The glass is already empty\".\n",

Eg. \"The glass breaks. Now there is water all over the floor\", or \"The glass can not be filled, since it's broken\", etc."
